# SymArt
A project to create geometrical and mathematical art. 

The drawing interface for SymArt is now live at [SymArt Drawing Interface](https://pedrou2000.github.io/SymArt/drawing_interface.html).

Feel free to try it out and explore the features!

<!-- ### To Implement

Fractal Symmetry: Implement recursive patterns that produce fractals. Users could click to place the seed of a fractal, and the system could generate the fractal pattern from there.

Wave Symmetry: Introduce wave-like or oscillatory symmetry where the drawn patterns are reflected as waves with controllable frequency and amplitude.

Glide Reflection: This symmetry involves a translation combined with a reflection across a line, creating a 'gliding' effect.

Tessellation: Allow users to create patterns that tessellate the plane. The app could offer different types of tessellations like regular, semi-regular, or even Escher-like tessellations.

Color Symmetry: Introduce symmetry in color changes, where drawing with one color in one segment automatically selects a complementary or analogous color in another.

Interactive Symmetry Breaking: Offer the option to introduce small, controlled breaks in the symmetry to create more natural and less rigid patterns.

Dynamic Symmetry: The pattern changes over time or in response to user input, such as expanding, contracting, or rotating dynamically as more lines are added.

Layered Symmetry: Allow users to create multiple layers of symmetry that can be individually toggled on and off, creating a complex overlay of symmetrical designs.

Möbius Symmetry: Inspired by the Möbius strip, this would create patterns that twist and connect in unexpected ways, challenging the conventional perception of symmetry.

3D Symmetry: Introduce a 3D view where users can draw in a 3D space, with symmetries represented on various planes or around a sphere.

Symmetry Transformation: Allow users to morph between different symmetry types, blending one into another for a fluid and dynamic effect.

Sound-Activated Symmetry: Use microphone input to alter the symmetry based on sound or music, creating visual patterns that respond to audio.

Custom Symmetry Axes: Users can define their own axes of symmetry, placing and angling them as they wish on the canvas.
